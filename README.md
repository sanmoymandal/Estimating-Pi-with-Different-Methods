Among many ways to estimate Pi, here are the four ways by which one can do that.
Primarily the Jupyter notebook contains two ways using Monte Carlo simulations technique and another two using infinite sum using number of iterations 
1. Inscribed circle within a square method (using Monte Carlo)
2. Buffon's Needle Problem (using Monte Carlo)
3. Riemann Zeta Function for s = 2 (iterations)
4. Nilakantha Series (iterations)
